# frontend

## intro

welcome to the frontend portion of the take home. feel free to edit any part of the code base you feel you need to!

## API

## TODO

1. fix the search function - Done
1. add a recipe component to display the response - Done

1. add routing so that you can land on a recipe page or reload and have the same search - Not done, as the app runs without this I left this to do later

## Assumptions and Decisions

- 95% of my time on this project was in the frontend, A lot of time was spent familiarising myself with class based react components as I've been working in a code base with only functional for the last couple of years. I am also not used to connect redux architecture, having only used the hooks in the past.
- I timeboxed switching over the frontend project to be typescript. It hit a snag with the react typings not showing up so left it. Would definitely be an improvement for the app to add types.
- I also timeboxed converting the react components to be Functional but worked out it would take too much of my 4 hours to convert it.
- I used HTML elements with styled components as that was mostly out Home was done. I would replace these with Martial UI elements and useStyles.
